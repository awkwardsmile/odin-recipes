        <p>Tomato Chutney is a staple dish in southern parts of India where it is usually served as a side dish along with a main dish such as <a href="../Images/wp6734909.jpg">Dosa</a>,<a href="../Images/istockphoto-526846282-612x612.jpg">Chappatis</a>, etc. It's a paste/mixture of tomato puree, and spices and tastes absolutely delicious when eaten fresh! It's also very easy to make and can be a quick dish to go along with your rotis, dosas etc. I eat them almost 3-4 times a week along with my dosas and never get tired of it! The spicyness and the paste like texture is a delight to eat and it's honestly one of my favourites.</p>
